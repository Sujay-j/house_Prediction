The dataset we’re using for this series of tutorials was curated by Ahmed and Moustafa in their 2016 paper, House price estimation from visual and textual features.

As far as I know, this is the first publicly available dataset that includes both numerical/categorical attributes along with images.

The numerical and categorical attributes include:

Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Area (i.e., square footage)
Zip code
Four images of each house are also provided:

Bedroom
Bathroom
Kitchen
Frontal view of the house
A total of 535 houses are included in the dataset, therefore there are 535 x 4 = 2,140 total images in the dataset.

We’ll be pruning that number down to 362 houses (1,448 images) during our data cleaning.
